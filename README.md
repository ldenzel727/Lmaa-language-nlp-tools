# Lmaa-language-nlp-tools
A project to develop NLP tools like tokenizers, POS taggers, and named entity recognizers for low-resource languages.

# Low-Resource Language NLP Tools

## Purpose
This project aims to develop natural language processing (NLP) tools like tokenizers, part-of-speech (POS) taggers, and named entity recognizers (NER) for low-resource languages. These tools are crucial for processing and analyzing text in languages that lack extensive digital resources.

## Features
- **Custom Tokenizers**: Build tokenizers that are adapted to the specific needs of low-resource languages, accounting for unique punctuation, sentence structure, and word formation.
- **POS Taggers**: Develop and train part-of-speech taggers using manually annotated corpora, enabling grammatical analysis of text.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Create rule-based and machine learning-based named entity recognition systems to identify proper nouns like names of people, places, and organizations.

## Potential Benefits
- **Language Preservation**: By creating NLP tools for low-resource languages, this project helps in the preservation and digital documentation of these languages.
- **Educational Tools**: These tools can be used in educational settings, helping linguists, educators, and students engage with low-resource languages more effectively.
- **Cross-Language NLP**: The project may also contribute to cross-language NLP tasks, where insights from one language can aid the processing of another.

## Support and Collaboration
We welcome collaboration from linguists, data scientists, and developers interested in NLP, especially those with experience in low-resource languages. Contributions can range from providing data, writing code, or even testing and improving existing models.
